          As a 16-year-old software developer, I specialize in systems
          programming with a primary focus on Rust, complemented by a strong
          foundation in Python. While my passion lies with low-level
          development, I am also familiar with languages like C++, Java,
          TypeScript, HTML, and CSS from various projects. I&apos;m
          captivated by the intricate &quot;ins and outs&quot; of
          computing—the challenge and control that come with low-level
          development. The incredible leap in performance from early
          computers to today&apos;s systems inspires me to engineer software
          that is both powerful and efficient.

                Currently, I am diving deeper into asynchronous programming in
                Rust, focusing on advanced benchmarking and optimization
                techniques to push my code to its limits. My ambition extends to
                building foundational technologies from the ground up, with
                long-term goals that include developing a complete operating
                system, creating a feature-rich database engine named TransientDB,
                and evolving my assembly project into a full-fledged programming
                language. I am driven by the pursuit of solving complex problems
                and engineering the robust, high-performance systems of the
                future.
